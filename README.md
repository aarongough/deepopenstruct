# DeepOpenStruct

DeepOpenStruct is a simple library for creating easy-to-use data structures from complex sets of nested Hashes and Arrays. It is particularly suitable for creating easy-to-use data structures from YAML files, and as such is a useful tool for creating simple reflective API wrappers.

## Installation

Add DeepOpenStruct to your gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'deepopenstruct', '~>0.1.3'
```

And then execute:

```
bundle install
```

Or install it manually by entering the following at your command line:

```
gem install deepopenstruct
```
  
## Usage

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'deepopenstruct'

complex_data = {
  :name => "Bob Winkle",
  :age => 65,
  :jobs => [
    {'start_year' => 1980, 'title' => 'Chef'},
    {'start_year' => 1985, 'title' => 'Programmer'}
  ],
  :attributes => {
    :birthplace => "Darwin",
    :year_of_birth => 1945
  }
}

simple_data = DeepOpenStruct.load(complex_data)

simple_data.name
# => "Bob Winkle"

simple_data.jobs.first.title
# => "Chef"

simple_data.attributes.birthplace
# => "Darwin"
```
